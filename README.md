# PluralSight Coding Challenge

Instructions to run the code:

1) 'UserSimilarity.ipynb' file reads the data from CSV files in the data_files folder. 

2) Run the read_and_process() function in order to get the required output.
After the preprocessing, it gives the final data as "final_data.csv" and model as "user_similarity.pkl"

3) Run the flask_app.py from the terminal which takes in finaldata.csv and user_similarity.pkl as inputs.

4) Output can be found at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/getSimilarUsers/*userid*
